		<div class="faq">
			<div class="faq_question">The application or setup won't launch!<span></span></div>
			<div class="faqcontent">
				You must have Java 6 or newer version installed on your machine or the one
				running the setup! Then if you get an error when launching the jar file, you should run it
				from inside a terminal session and use the command: <b>java -jar path/to/file.jar</b>
			</div>
			<span class="bottom_rounded"></span>
			<hr />
		</div>
		<div class="faq">
			<div class="faq_question">How can I use the Custom filters?<span></span></div>
			<div class="faqcontent">
				Edit the 'settings.json' file and add the file extensions you want to filter at the
				'cust1Ext' or 'cust2Ext' field, then restart the application and use the 2 Custom check-boxes
				to enable or disable the filters.
			</div>
			<span class="bottom_rounded"></span>
			<hr />
		</div>
		<div class="faq">
			<div class="faq_question">Why does the text box appear in red?<span></span></div>
			<div class="faqcontent">
				When a validation error occurs on an input, the text box becomes red.<br/>
				When the pack name appears in red, that means another pack has that same name and you should change the name
				of one of them to compile successfully.<br/>
				When the file path appears in red, that means the path entered or the file in that path doesn't exist.
			</div>
			<span class="bottom_rounded"></span>
			<hr />
		</div>
		<div class="faq">
			<div class="faq_question">How do I make a web setup?<span></span></div>
			<div class="faqcontent">
				After you enable the Websetup option at Build tab, you specify the http url from which
				the setup will download all of the packs. Then at compile, the application creates the web setup
				file in addition to other jar files for every pack.<br/>
				You should send those files manually at the directory accessible through the url you gave, or let
				the application do the work for you by pressing the 'configuration' button beside the url field
				, activating the automatic transfer and filling the form with the information needed to connect via SFTP.
			</div>
			<span class="bottom_rounded"></span>
			<hr />
		</div>
		<div class="faq">
			<div class="faq_question">I am getting a compilation error! What should I do?<span></span></div>
			<div class="faqcontent">
				Try going back through settings and look for a red textbox that may contain an error or a path that doesn't exist.<br/>
				- A Pack must not have the same name as another Pack or a Group.<br/>
				- A Pack shouldn't be dependent on a Pack that is also dependent on it (circular dependency)<br/>
				- A Pack destinated to a certain OS shouldn't be dependant on a Pack destinated to another OS!<br/>
				- The Install path of a Pack is relative to the Global install path given at the Tweak step, so it should only contain the path inside the directory.<br/>
				- Make sure the SFTP information you put is correct if you are building a web setup with automatic file transfer enabled.<br/>
				Also, if you are running the application from a terminal, make sure you are positioned at its home directory containing all required files.

		<div class="faq">
			<div class="faq_question">Can I change the order of packs deployed on install?<span></span></div>
			<div class="faqcontent">
				Yes, packs are deployed following their displayed order on DCP Setup Maker.<br/>
				You can reorder them by pressing the "sort" button on the 'Set' tab, at left of packs view.

		<div class="faq">
			<div class="faq_question">I have images on my computer that the program doesn't recognise!<span></span></div>
			<div class="faqcontent">
				The application is by default recognising only the standard file extensions, but you can add yours if you want to.<br/>
				All you need to do is go to the base directory of the program and open the file <b>'settings.json'</b> with a text editor
				then add or delete the extensions you want from the different file types in the <i>"extensions"</i> group.<br/>
				Save the file and relaunch the application.

		</div>
		<div class="faq">
			<div class="faq_question">How can I make my script use other files at execution?<span></span></div>
			<div class="faqcontent">
				If you need to execute files from your batch or shell script, you may make the corresponding pack as executable and
				add the needed file as a dependent pack (or group if more than one file), then edit the paths in your script to use
				the temporary environment variable 'DEP' for accessing all of the files.<br/><br/>
				Example of a batch script that depends on the pack 'putty_hosts.reg' in Windows:<br/>
				<center><b><i>reg import %DEP%putty_hosts.reg</i></b></center><br/>
				In Linux, using the variable would be like "<i>$DEP</i>" instead.<br/>
				<b>PS:</b>Registry files can be executed automatically by making them 'execute'.

		<div class="faq">
			<div class="faq_question">Can I recover the factory settings of DCP Setup Maker?<span></span></div>
			<div class="faqcontent">
				You can do so by going to the root directory of the program and deleting the file 'conf.dcp' which contains
				all the information and default settings you saved.<br/>
				The next time you run DCP Setup Maker it will generate a new configurations file with factory settings.

		</div>
		<div class="faq">
			<div class="faq_question">Can I add more advanced features to my package?<span></span></div>
			<div class="faqcontent">
				You can use the <a href="http://izpack.org" target="_blank">IzPack</a> xml specifications.<br/>
				You go to the application's root directory, and edit the file 'settings.json' with notepad, 
				then at the bottom you have two options ("izpackWrite" and "izpackCompile") set to "yes" by default.<br/>
				You first set "izpackCompile" to "no" then launch Setup Maker and compile your project so that 
				it only generates the izpack 'install.xml' file you need.<br/>
				After you make the edits you need, you change "izpackWrite" to "no" and restore 
				"izpackCompile" to "yes" then relaunch Setup Maker and Compile again to get your custom package.<br/><br/>
				Don't forget to save your project to load it after you make changes to settings.json!
