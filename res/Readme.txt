DevComPack Setup Maker
======================

A Java-based application for creating installation packages.

DevComPack Setup Maker is a compact application designed to create Java installers by  using IzPack. The application allows you to scan the directory that contains your files and to configure the installer preferences by using a wizard-like interface.

You can tweak your installer by adding the author data and logo images before building the installer.

Requirements:
· Java


IzPack
======

IzPack is a one-stop solution for packaging, distributing and deploying
applications.

It is fully cross-platform and generates a single installer. As such,
it is an alternative to native solutions such as platform-specific 
installers and package managers.

IzPack-generated installers only require a Java virtual machine to run.
It is however capable of providing integration with the host operating
systems (e.g., creating desktop shortcuts or editing the Windows registry).
